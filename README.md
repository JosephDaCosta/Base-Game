# Base-Game
It is a **simple game** of _questions and answers_. I did small on purpose because the idea is to inspire people to _implement their own ideas_.

My focus on this project was construct a instructure that have **essentials elements** for a development of a game, like machine actions, player actions, restart game, game over and the _**most important**_ is the infinite looping of the game because it is not finished if the player not win lose or give up.
